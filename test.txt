Name: Noojarla Mahith Kumar

Graduated In New Horizon College of Engineering in the Month_year of May_2025

I am from Andhra Pradesh

Gender: Male

On 1st August I Have joined the I-exceed Company

It's a Product-Based Company

I am working in this company as a Software Developer Trainee...

My First Assessment was on java project!!!

I have Chosen a Project on Cryptographic Principles...

My Project name : Quantum Shield Vault   //"Quantum" meant for cutting edge technologies making the data encryption standard algorithm like AES or DES...                              
                                           "Shield" meant the security standards for data Encryption methods... and "vault" is about the storage of file                                                             
                                            are existing for the Encryption purpose...

It's completely based on the cryptography

Using OOPS concepts: Abstraction - Taking the Abstract class as crypto Operation
                     Inheritance - Taking an File Encryptor and File Decryptor extends from crypto Operation
                     Polymorphism - Taking Crypto Manager will works with any cryptoOperation as subclass at runtime
                     Encapsulation - Data and Key are kept in a private and protected access modifier inside the class
